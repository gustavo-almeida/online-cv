  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm an experienced professional with over 10 years of expertise in Software Testing and Quality Assurance. I hold a degree in Information Systems and an MBA in Big Data and Business Analytics from FGV.

    Throughout my career, I've developed strong skills in planning, developing, and executing manual and automated tests across all layers of software using various programming languages and tools.
