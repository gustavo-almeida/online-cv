        I led the software test lifecycle strategy of a financial application in the fund of funds market for one of Brazil's largest banks. As a consultant, I provided expertise in testing practices and successfully developed an automated test framework. By collaborating closely with the UX team, we enhanced application flows, ensuring a seamless user experience.

        Throughout my tenure, I worked on three diverse teams, each focused on different projects and technologies:

          - Refactored an entire end-to-end test project using Cypress and Javascript. Successfully automated test cases, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced time for regression testing.

          - Maintained and improved an end-to-end test project with Selenium, .NET Core, and SpecFlow. Streamlined test scenarios and contributed to the continuous improvement of test coverage.

          - Implemented tests in CI tools AWS CodeBuild and GitHub Actions, enabling seamless integration and automated testing in the development process.

          - In addition, I authored BDD documentation to enhance collaboration and communication between development and testing teams.

        Throughout these experiences, I honed my problem-solving, analytical thinking, and effective communication skills, contributing to successful project outcomes.

        As a leader of stress tests on an e-commerce platform, my role was crucial in ensuring its full functionality during periods of high demand. I spearheaded various routines including code reviews, implementing functionalities with unit tests, pair programming, and more. This period allowed me to deepen my knowledge of new technologies such as Typescript, Node.js, Docker, and Kubernetes.

        As part of the squad, I took responsibility for implementing a culture of testing and optimizing processes within the agile methodology. Key contributions included:

          - Creation of test environments and defining a comprehensive testing strategy.
          - Implementation of automated testing scenarios for both API and UI.
          - Integration of tests within the CI/CD pipeline, leveraging continuous integration practices.
          - Developing unit tests in the .NET language and integration tests using Postman/Newman.
          - Leveraging Cypress for UI testing and utilizing AWS services to enhance test infrastructure.

        Through these efforts, I ensured high-quality code and reliable product functionality. I collaborated closely with the development team to prioritize testing needs, identify potential issues, and implement effective solutions. By promoting a robust testing culture, I significantly improved the overall product quality and the team's efficiency.

        Additionally, I actively participated in knowledge-sharing sessions, mentoring teammates on testing best practices and advocating for the importance of quality assurance throughout the development process.

        Overall, my leadership in stress testing, implementation of automated testing, and establishment of efficient processes played a vital role in achieving high-quality deliverables within the agile environment.
